# Excel-Parser
This is a simple Excel Parser. It reads and cleans selected data from an excel sheet. You can perform basic operations such as mean, standard deviation/variace on the selected data. You can also perform t-tests(single, double and paired). 

In the file labelled example, there is a more complex script whose base is the given parser. The file labeled 'FullParser' is a script created to analyse data for a drug study. While the data can not be shared for privacy conserns, the script sttill functions as an example of what can be achieved.
